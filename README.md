The main program is in `main.py` but the functions and logic which powers it is in `utils.py`.
The unit tests are in `test_utils.py` (The name of this file is a requirement of the unit testing library I am running).

1. Install Python 3 on your machine
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 nstall -r requirements.txt` to install dependencies
3. Run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` to run the program
